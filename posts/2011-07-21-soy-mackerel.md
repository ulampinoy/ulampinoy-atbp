I miss _Adobong galunggong,_ a popular and favorite Filipino dish. It's fish braised in soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and garlic. It’s something we used to have weekly. Both words are iconic in the Philippines – adobo & galunggong ...

The closest fish I can get here in Madrid for this recipe is the _caballa_ or the Atlantic Mackerel. Well, at least it is a mackerel.

### Ingredients

* Caballa (Mackerel)
* Garlic
* Mushrooms
* Pimiento de Padrón (green chili pepper)
* Soy sauce (naturally fermented)
* Lime juice or cider vinegar
* Ginger
* Laurel (bay leaf)
* Olive oil
* Hierbas provenzales (Albahaca, Orégano, Romero, Tomillo, Ajedrea & Mejorana)
* Salt & pepper
* Pimientos del piquillo, for garnish

### Procedure

1. Cut the mackerel in halves then rub with hierbas provenzales. Set aside.
2. In a pan, mix the soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, ginger, laurel, olive oli, salt & pepper
3. Put the mackerel in the marinade and cook in medium-low heat
4. Slow cook until the liquid is reduced & add the mushrooms and chilis
5. When the marinade has been reduced, it will start to sizzle. Let it fry until the skin of the mackerel is crispy.
