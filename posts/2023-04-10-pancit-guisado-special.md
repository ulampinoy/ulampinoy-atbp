sideNote: Pancit bihon noodles are made from rice flour, which gives them a distinct flavor and texture. Unlike other types of noodles, such as wheat or egg noodles, pancit bihon noodles are gluten-free, making them a popular choice for those with gluten allergies or sensitivities. Bihon noodles are thin and delicate, which makes them easy to cook and adds a delicate texture to the dish. When cooked properly, they have a slightly chewy texture that pairs well with the other ingredients in the dish.
