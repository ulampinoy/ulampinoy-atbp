February 2017 – A very special month as we welcome home the newest member of Ulam Pinoy team! 

Winter in Madrid during the first half of the month of February is typically the coldest during the chilly season. Snowfall is very scarce but temperature can drop down to -7°C to -5°C yet there's the luxury of sunny blue skies for most of the winter days.

Can't complain for the lack of snowflakes but if you feel like going to a wintery snow place, take a drive for less than an hour to the mountain *(sierras de Madrid)* and you can have the cold white frozen water experience.

Bright chilly days calls for some warm comfort in a bowl.

**Chicken broth soup** made from scratch with vegetable bits (cabbage, flat green beans and carrots) garnished with boiled eggs. The other version of this dish is with *sotanghon* or glass noodles.

**Chicharro** (Trachurus lathami) or rough scad, specially when in season is abundantly available in the most markets in Madrid. Simply frying until skin is crispy is a great pair for any soup or broth dish.

![Beef Broccoli serve in a black bowl](/static/images/beef-broccoli-2017.jpg)
**Beef Broccoli** is a quick wok stir-fry of beef chuck steak cut into strips and supermarket-fresh broccoli tossed with a load of garlic with oyster sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil. Garnish with tosted sesame seeds.

Specially in the cold days and mornings, a great cup of freshly made coffee to start your daily grind that fills the house the irresistable aroma and fill you with the little simple joys in life!
