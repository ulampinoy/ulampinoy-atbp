Lumpiang Shanghai is a popular Filipino appetizer that is typically served during special occasions, parties, or family gatherings. 

The dish's popularity in the Philippines can be attributed to the country's diverse culinary influences, including Chinese, Spanish, and American cuisine.

Here is a tasty recipe for making lumpiang shanghai:

### Ingredients:

- 1 lb ground pork
- 1 cup carrots, finely chopped
- 1 cup green onions, finely chopped
- 1 cup onions, finely chopped
- 1 cup water chestnuts, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 pack (25-30 pieces) lumpia wrappers
- 1 egg, beaten
- Vegetable oil, for frying

### Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine ground pork, carrots, green onions, onions, water chestnuts, garlic, soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.
2. Take a lumpia wrapper and place a spoonful of the meat mixture at the center of the wrapper. Roll the wrapper tightly around the filling, tucking in the sides as you go. Use a bit of beaten egg to seal the wrapper.
3. Repeat the process until all of the filling has been used up.
4. Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the lumpia rolls to the pan, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
5. Fry the lumpia rolls for about 5-7 minutes or until golden brown, turning them occasionally to cook all sides.
