Once in a while you would need to eat vegetables to have a meat dish reset. Vegetable dishes need not to be boring nor bland. Pinakbet are both rich in flavor and packed with nutrition. 

Originated from the Ilocos region of the Philippines, it is the main vegetable dish that most Filipinos (local and global) make as a home-cooked dish and on few specials occasions as well.
 
Pinakbet can be modest with just vegetables or can be extravagant with the addition of bagnet (Ilokano-style crispy pork belly) or topped with fish. What make's it distinct to other gulay is the main vegetable ingedients â€” Ampalaya. You omit putting bitter gourd on the dish, then you must call it another name!
