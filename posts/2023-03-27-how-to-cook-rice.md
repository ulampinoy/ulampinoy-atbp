sideNote: Rice is believed to have been first cultivated in China around 6,000 years ago, in the Yangtze River valley. From there, rice cultivation spread to other parts of Asia, including India, Southeast Asia, and eventually the Philippines. Archaeological evidence suggests that rice was also cultivated in the Ganges River valley in India around 5,000 years ago. Over time, rice became a staple crop in many parts of Asia and has remained an important food source for millions of people around the world.

The Filipino way of cooking rice is a simple and straightforward method that involves boiling rice in water until it is fully cooked. The resulting rice is fluffy, tender, and perfect for serving as a staple in many Filipino meals.
Here's a simple recipe for cooking rice the Filipino way:

Ingredients:

- 2 cups of rice
- 2.5 cups of water

Instructions:

1. Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and dirt from the rice.

2. Add the rinsed rice to a pot and add water. The ratio of rice to water is usually 1:1.25 or 1:1.5 depending on the variety of rice used. For this recipe, we'll use 1:1.25 ratio.

3. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid.

4. Allow the rice to cook for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not lift the lid or stir the rice during this time to prevent steam from escaping. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for 5 minutes. Keep the lid on during this time.

Serve hot with your favorite ulam!
