## Ginisang Upo at Inihaw na Isda

We got some young bottle gourd and we made some ginisang upo.

The richness of the coconut milk is well-balanced with the savory acidity developed while cooking the fish in spiced vinegar. Ginataan like adobo are those dishes that gets even tastier the day after or so. All you need now is a cup or two of freshly cooked, steaming hot rice. üçöüêüüå∂

## Stir-fried Zayote and Bitsuelas

In most supermarket here in Madrid you can find ***bitsuelas*** beans. But to acquire ***zayote*** (chayote) you have to go to some specific stalls in some specific markets or in an Asian store where they have it in pack of two's. Zayotes are great alternative to green papaya for chicken tinolas but since we have some nice ***jud√≠as bobby*** we instead did a stir-fry vegetables with ground pork, the usual garlic, onions and tomatoes trio. And you get a hearty **gulay** dish that can be an **ulam** in itself or with some fried fish will serve as a great side dish!

## Red Onion Mushroom Omelette
Fast and easy to make country-style omelette using leftover onion slices we have most of the time after doing saut√©. Sweat the onions with some olive oil. Throw-in some sliced button mushrooms. Break and beat up a couple of eggs. Voila, breakfast is served!
