description: Take a moment and enjoy a nostalgic poem about our beloved Kare-kare, a traditional Filipino stew made with a rich and savory peanut sauce, vegetables and a variety of meats such as oxtail, beef, or tripe.
whetter: Kare-kare Care
sideNote: Bagoong alamang is a fermented shrimp paste that is an essential ingredient in many Filipino dishes, including beef kare-kare. It is a salty and savory condiment that adds depth of flavor to the dish and serves as a perfect complement to the richness of the peanut sauce. The combination of the creamy peanut sauce and the salty, umami-rich bagoong alamang is what makes beef kare-kare such a beloved and unique dish in Filipino cuisine.

This is poem is dedicated to the Filipino diaspora...

Kare-kare, a dish so dear\
Filling my heart with memories clear\
A taste of home, a taste of love\
From my childhood, to where I've rove

Peanut sauce, a rich delight\
Blended with shrimp paste, oh what a sight\
Beef or oxtail, it's up to you\
Mixed with veggies, a colorful hue

The smell alone, takes me back\
To grandma's kitchen, what a knack\
The flavors, the aromas, so distinct\
A dish so perfect, one cannot blink

From fiestas, to family gatherings\
Kare-kare, a dish worth savoring\
It brings us together, as one big clan\
A connection, a bond, that forever stands

Now, as I live so far away\
Kare-kare, my heart does sway\
A taste of home, a taste of love\
From my memories, to the stars above.
