sideNote: What really sets flank steak apart is its texture. When thinly sliced against the grain, the resulting pieces of beef are tender and easy to bite into. This is important for a sandwich like the Pepito de Ternera, where you want the beef to be the star of the show and not an overwhelming challenge to eat.

Filipino Green Mango Salad is a delightful and refreshing salad featuring the unripe green mangoes. These mangoes are known for their crisp texture and sharp tartness. When combined with tomatoes, onions, and a zesty dressing, you get a salad that's a burst of sweet, sour, and savory flavors in every bite.
