Ginisang Monggo, the comfort food for all seasons. This I can have this every week. [Paired with _pritong isda_](/2011/07/21/monggo-tamban/) or _paksiw na isda_ is even better.

**Quick tip:** One of the essential step for the recipe is pre-cooking the mung beans by boiling until the skin of the beans separate. You don't have to throw it.
