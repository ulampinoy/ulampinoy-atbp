We love burgers! If you have meat between those buns why not with rice? And if it has to be a rice topping it needs to have sarsa (sauce). This is why burger steak is a perfect ulam!

The burger patties were prepared with a bit more of spices than the usual for hamburgers. It is loaded with garlic and a loads of ground black pepper. Adding up these will make it more connected as a rice topping. The gravy sauce is buttery and mushrooms were added to give a distinct taste and looks good for garnish.
