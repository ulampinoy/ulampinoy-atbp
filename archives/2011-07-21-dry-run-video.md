This is a re-post from my previous Posterous site. Check out the dry run video I made before actually launching the [UlamPinoy channel at YouTube][5]

I have finally made a [YouTube channel][1] and uploaded the very first video which is more of a test drive for the [Lumix TZ7][2] HD video capabilities. I am happy with what I am getting right now on both photos and videos. I did all the importing and editing in [iMovie][3] and the [AVCHD][4] was handled nicely. I came up with the idea of shooting a weekly episode of the [Ulam Pinoy Series][1] which obviously is a showcase of how-to cooking videos of my own version of some popular Filipino dishes. Enjoy!

Serve with steamed brown rice, garnished with a slice of lemon, parsley, grilled red bell peppers and paired with a glass of beer.
