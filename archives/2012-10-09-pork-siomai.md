Siomai is the Philippines most popular dim sum. You can find it everywhere – from the tiniest streets to the mega malls. Siomai is easily the fastest merienda or even an ulam option. It has the perfect combination of pork and spicy dip (saw-sawan).

Siomai comes in different varieties and flavor mutations but we love the classic and simple pork siomai.

* 1 medium carrot, grated
* 1 medium. finely chopped

### Quick Tips
* If you are buying your meat from the market or meatshop, choose pork cut with layers of fat like pork belly and have it grounded twice to make finer textured dumplings.
* You can add shrimp to add another layer of flavor.
* Use a grater for the onions and carrots – easier and finer results than chopping with knife.
