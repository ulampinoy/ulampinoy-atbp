Sampaloc, also known as tamarind, is a tropical fruit tree that is native to Africa but widely cultivated in many tropical regions, including the Philippines. 

The fruit of the sampaloc tree is a brown, pod-like structure that contains a sour pulp with several hard seeds. The pulp has a tangy, sour taste that is often used in Filipino cuisine to add a sour flavor to dishes.

Sampaloc is a popular ingredient in Filipino dishes, such as sinigang, a sour soup made with pork, seafood, or vegetables. It is also used to make tamarind candy, a sweet and sour treat made by boiling the pulp with sugar and then allowing it to harden.
Nutritional value: Sampaloc is rich in vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, potassium, and magnesium. It is also a good source of antioxidants and dietary fiber.
