I was in Barcelona, Spain last October 2015 to attend the [Smashing Conference](http://smashingconf.com/barcelona-2015/). It was a great fun experience! Although it was already my fifth visit, there are always new things and places to discover in Barcelona.

The conference venue was the magnificent Palau de la Música Catalana. The grandoise ceiling (shown above), stained-glass works and all the details are just splendid.

During lunch breaks the attendees were encouraged to roam around the block close to the venue. My plan was simple: Spot the local attendees and follow their lunch trail. It always works! So, plus points there for decoding Spanish!

It took us some ten minutes of navigating the tiny streets of Barcelona until the leader of the pack declared that we arrived to the spot. [Hamburguesería Bacoa](http://www.bacoa.es/en/) makes superb burgers. My lunch was the **Asturiana,** which according to the menu: organic beef char-grilled to medium, tomato, lettuce, goat and Danish blue cheese and caramelized onions. Paired with local *Mortiz* beer. It was delicious.
