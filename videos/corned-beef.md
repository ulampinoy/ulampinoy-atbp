sideNote: Nutmeg or **nuez moscada** in Spanish, is the key spice that makes the distinct flavor of the corned beef we know and love. Without nutmeg will still be tasty pulled beef or carne mechada that you have with tacos but with it you will be proud that you could remake corned beef!

In today's episode, we want to share how to make Filipino style CORNED BEEF that is both juicy and meaty. Pinoy-style canned corned beef is packed with more flavors and texture than the 'imported' versions.

Do not be intimidated with the big flavors you get when you open a can of your favorite corned beef. The truth is, it's simple and easy to make with just a few ingredients. Try it and you'll have unlimited Carne Norte!

## Ingredients
- 1 kg. Beef Shank
- 1 tsp. Nutmeg
- 1 tsp. Onion Powder
- 1 tsp. Garlic Powder
- 1 tbsp. Salt
- 2.5 cups Water

Beef shank is our preferred cuts of meat since it offers all three components‚Äîlean, fat and cartilage which are essential to recreate the distinct Pinoy-style corned beef. Beef brisket or chuck is also an alternative cut.

## Procedure
1. In the pressure cooker pot, put the beef cuts, all the spices (nutmeg, onion powder, garlic powder) and salt. Add in water and mix it a bit.
2. Cover and secure the lid. Bring the heat to high until steam starts to come out then reduce heat to medium. Pressure cook for **45 minutes to 1 hour.**
3. Turn off heat and release pressure. Open the lid carefully. Use two forks to pull apart the meat.

Now that we have our homemade corned beef, let's cook **Ginisang Corned Beef.**
Saut√© the corned beef with fresh garlic, patis, black peper and onion rings to garnish. Serve with rice and sunny-side up egg. Another tasty way to cook
