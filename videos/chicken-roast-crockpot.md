In this episode we cooked our own take of Lechon Manok. Rubbed with herbs and spices, then left seated in a Crock-Pot¬Æ, slow-cooking for 3.5 hours at high temp. Finished it in the oven at grill mode to get that golden brown cripy skin!s

With a few ingrdients and a lot of patience, we are deliciously rewarded with a savory, tender juicy and crispy roasted chicken!! üçóü•ó

## INGREDIENTS
- 1 whole chicken
- 1 tbs. thyme
- 1 tbs. rosemary
- 1 tbs. oregano
- 1/2 tbs. paprika
- 1 tbs. salt
- 1/2 crushed black pepper
- 1 pc. lemon

## PROCEDURE
1. In a big bowl, mix all herbs and spices (salt, black pepper, paprika, thyme, rosemary, oregano). Rub the whole chicken thoroughly. Use a spoon to go under the chicken skin. Cut lemon in wedges and squeeze out the juice then insert the wedges into the chicken cavity. Tie together the end of the legs to keep the whole chicken intact.

2. Place a stand on the bottom of the slow-cooker then seat the seasoned whole chicken. Cover and set temperature to HIGH; set timer to 3.5 HOURS.

3. Pre-heat oven set to GRILL mode at the HIGHEST temperature setting. Put in the slow-cooked chicken in the oven breast-side up at first. At around 5-7 minutes the skin will start to crisp, flip it back-side up and finish it until chicken skin is golden crispy. Served with potato and fresh green salad.
