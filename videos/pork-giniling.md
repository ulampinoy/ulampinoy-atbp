Simple as saut√©ing it in patis (fish sauce) and using some fresh ripe chopped tomatoes instead of adding tomato sauce.

## Ingredients
- Ground pork
- Potato
- Carrot
- Green peas
- Cooking oil
- Garlic
- Onions
- Patis
- Salt and black pepper

Chopping the pork meat finely makes some uneven bits thus giving a bit more texture but of course buying the ground meat is convinient.

## Procedure
1. **Pre-fry potatoes, carrots and green peas** gives the vegetable a light crust for more flavor and texture. Set aside.
2. Heat some oil in a skillet pan and **sear until golden brown.** Set on high heat enough to brown the ground meat sealing it so it doesn't dry out. Set aside.

3. **Saut√©** the chopped garlic and sliced onions. Add diced tomatoes. Saut√© until aromatic and tomato has soften.
4. **Add the stir-fried garlic, onions, tomato to the seared meat.** Stir well to combine. Add water or stock to deglace the fond. Add bay leaves. Cover and simmer.
5. **Add in the pre-fried vegetable.** Mix to get all the ingredient to blend and get along well with each other. Cover and simmer some more until meat is tender and sauce starts to thicken.
6. **Salt and black pepper** to taste. Serve with rice or as palaman!
