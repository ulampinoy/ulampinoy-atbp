In this episode, let's upscale the usual pan-fried chicken fillets by making some blue cheese sauce with *champiñones* or button mushrooms.

The creamy gravy sauce gives the chicken additional depth and moisture while the blue cheese give a very nice shart contrast to it. And the mushrooms add in another type of texture to the bite and *umami* boost!

## Ingredients
- Chicken fillets
- Salt and black pepper
- Aromatic herbs *(oregano, thyme, rosemary - this is optional)*
- Cooking oil for frying
- Garlic
- Onions
- Mushrooms *(button or assorted)*
- Blue cheese *(Roquefort)*
- Heavy cream

Filleted and deboned **chicken thighs** are the preferred cuts because of its texture and juicier than the chicken breast.

In the video we used bottle-preserved mushrooms but **fresh whole mushrooms** are the best if you can source it, because it offers some pleasant earthy, nutty flavors to the dish.

## Procedure
1. **Dust the chicken fillets** with salt, crushed black pepper and herbs on both sides. Set aside.
2. Heat some oil in a skillet pan and **fry the chicken fillets.** Fry until both sides develops a light crust and golden brown in color. When finished frying, set aside the oil and leave just a small amount.
3. **Sauté** the chopped garlic and sliced onions. Add mushrooms. Sauté for another minute or two. Add blue cheese. Pour in the heavy cream. Stir well while bring it to a mild simmer.
4. **Drop the fried chicken fillets into the sauce.** Stir thouroghly to cover the chicken with the gravy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with parsley and serve.
