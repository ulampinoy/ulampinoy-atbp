## Pepito de Ternera

Let's talk about the **Pepito de Ternera** of Madrid. This sandwich is a true work of art, and the secret to its success lies in its simplicity.

Let's start with the star of the show - **the beef.** This thinly sliced sirloin or flank steak is seasoned with just a pinch of sea salt, drizzle of olive oil, then pan-grilled, *a la plancha,* as they say it, to juicy perfection. It's so tender and full of flavor that you'll be tempted to eat it straight off the grill.

But we can't forget about **the bread,** my friends. The traditional roll used for the Pepito de Ternera is long and crusty on the outside, but soft on the inside. After it's sliced in half, it's lightly toasted on the grill, giving it a crispy texture that perfectly complements the tender beef.

And finally, we come to **the sea salt.** Just a sprinkle of this precious ingredient is all it takes to bring out the natural flavors of the beef and take this sandwich to the next level.
