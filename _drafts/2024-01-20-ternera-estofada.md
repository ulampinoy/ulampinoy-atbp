sideNote: Soy sauce was introduced to the Philippines by Chinese traders during the country's pre-colonial era, which dates back to the 10th century. Over time, the use of soy sauce in Filipino cooking evolved and became an integral part of dishes like Adobo, where it adds flavor, richness, and depth to the dish. Soy sauce savory and umami taste complements the sourness of the vinegar, creating a unique and satisfying flavor profile that is distinct to Adobo.

The Chinese word for soy sauce was introduced to the Philippines along with the condiment itself, and it was eventually adapted to the Tagalog language as "toyo".
